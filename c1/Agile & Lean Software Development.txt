Q: A software development team just started using Kanban. They had the following columns with WIP limit of 3 for each column on their Kanban board from left to right: Backlog(3), Analysis(3), Development(3), Testing(3), DeploymentThere are currently 3 items in Testing (3 items being tested)Similarly, there are 3 items in Development column (2 items are in development and 1 item is done being developed)One of the developers does not have anything to work on so the manager wants to add one more item to the development column so the developer looking for work can work on it.Which one of the following would be a valid action in this situation? (Select any 3)

○ Team should get together and discuss if we should increase the WIP limit of the development column as we have more developers and it will be smoother flow if WIP limit of the Development column is increased.
○ Add another tester in the Testing team so this bottleneck can be resolved quickly.
○ Manager should ask the developer waiting for work to help the testers so that they can finish one of the items from their column and move it to Deployment column.
The manager should ask the testers to move one of the items of the Test column temporarily to the Deployment column so that we can move items from the Development column. Later, we can move items back from the Deployment column to the Testing column.
It does not make sense for the developer to wait before one of the items moved to another column. The manager should add one more item to the development column and no other change needed.
